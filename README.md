# Aww CRUD, here we go again
This is a team assignment which will teach us how to connect to a database, write a simple Create, Read, Update and Delete application *and* how to use a provided MVC structure to work into.

Learning all that stuff, combined with working in group and improving our git behaviour, will make this assignment a *spicy one*.

In order to start out with the assignment, we will clear the following TO-DO list:
- [x] Create a basic Database
  - [x] Table for Students
  - [x] Table for Classes (groups)
  - [x] Table for Coaches
- [x] Create a router that selects different pages
- [x] Create a .gitignore that ignores the .env, .gitignore, and if needed, the .idea/
- [x] Add a .env.sample file to the repository
- [x] **Show our database on the view**
  - [x] Create a connection with the database
  - [x] Create a new Database in index
  - [x] Create a property 'Database' in the controller
    - [x] Just a generic Database, not specific information per controller.
  - [x] Be able to do a 'getAllCoaches' in the view, or wherever you'd like as long as it works.
    - [x] Learn a bit more about PDO and how to utilize it.

Once we're done with that TODO list, we can once again have a group meeting to further decide on small future goals and how to achieve them.
The very first big goal we have, is to be able to show our database on the view.
Once that's done and we're 1000% sure everything's connected, we can go ahead and get CRUD done.

## Putting the C in CRUD
Now that we're able to connect to the database, we can finally split up the work properly.
